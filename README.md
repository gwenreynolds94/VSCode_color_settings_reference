# VSCode Color Settings Reference  

I just put together some really basic formats of the color settings for theming VSCode.  

I used markdown to make a detailed reference with descriptions for every setting and I used json with another to make it easier to copy/paste settings and just fill in the values.  

I just copy/pasted the contents of the [reference on the VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color) and used regex to format it so it's not perfectly structured or organized. I just whipped it up for my own personal use and felt that it might be useful enough for other people.
